				<h2 class="title"style="text-align: center;">What is Identity?<h2>
			</section>
			<!-- As always, the following two <aside> components are facts about regarding the topic. The catch is, these ones are serious ones. -->
			<aside class="fact">
				<p>Serious Fact About Identity: <br><br>Imagine this: nearly 85% of all victims find out about their identity theft problem in a negative manner. For example, being denied a credit or debit card transaction.</p>
			</aside><!-- It's probably one of the top reasons why there are a lot of people who suddenly become broke, daily. -->
			<aside class="fact2">
				<p>Serious Fact About Identity (Pt.2): <br><br> Did you know that your childâ€™s social security number is also at risk? Child I.D. theft is becoming more and more common, and it often remains undetected because parents spend virtually no time monitoring it.</p>
			</aside><!-- Sorry for the massive amount of <br>'s, I didn't know what to put aside from those. -->
			<!-- Yahallo! This is where most of the information can be found about the topic! -->
			<section class="content">
				<p>Do you know what Identity is? The concept? The origin? If you said no, then this page will help you understand what Identity really is.</p>
				<p>To begin with, The questions you often ponder about like "Who am I?", "Why am I here?", "What do I really want to be in the future?", and "Am I someone capable of achieving that?" frequently pop inside your head when you have nothing to do and when you're alone, either in a room or outside. People like you answer these questions to identify more about themselves or just answer to pass the time but more often than not, you forget about them and your own answers.</p>
				<p>In addition to that, Identity can't really be controlled as it also has many more factors other than yourself. Identity that doesn't involve others is called Personal Identity. When involving others, whether it is online or offline, that's called Social Identity, that mostly involves friends, family, fame, popularity, and impressions from others. When we identify ourselves by our beliefs and practices, that's called Cultural and Religious Identity that mostly involves where you live and what your current religion is, whether it be Christian, Muslim, or another religion.</p>
				<p>In the end, Identity is something that changes easily depending on your point of view and the actions you take. One day, you're going to be a lot more famous, while some days you're going to be broke, Identity heavily on our situation which is something that is hard to control, hence Identity's uncontrollability.</p>
			</section><!-- Identity is honestly so complicated that I actually kind of regret choosing this topic and making it into a website, but oh well.
				  It was fun making a website for the first time, it might be a bit bad, but every first time turns out bad so that the next ones will be better. -->
