					<h3 id="title">Identity Crisis</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Identity Crisis generally revolves around a person's self-doubt that generated due to peer pressure. People that are in this phase of life usually lost their identities or trying to view theirself while being in other's shoes.</p>
				<p>While striving for self-improvement, people generally ask themselves multiple questions that they answer in a philosophical way for them to understand theirselves in a better and deeper way. Questions like "What is my purpose in life?", "Do I change myself to benefit myself or others?", and "If I did have a purpose, what would I be in this specific society?". These kinds of questions are often overlooked by people who haven't gone through Identity crisis. This is because the phase of having an Identity crisis only happens when a person experiences an extremely stressful situation that changed their view of life permanently.</p>
				<p>Since our identities are ever-changing, changes on how one thinks occur often, but because we are used to smaller changes in our life, a big change will have a huge impact to one's personality and mental health. This can lead to one or a few symptoms of depression or a sharp change in their social personality, especially when the change is negative. This type of change can also make them think in a much more negative way, like becoming pessimistic, always in low spirits, and loss of focus.</p>

					<h3 id="title">Identity Disturbance</h3>
				</header>
				<p>On to the next one, Identity Disturbance. Now this is actually quite common of a problem for introverts and can be calssified as a part of an introvert's dark side. Identity Disturbance is a type of mental conflict in which a person's identity, like goals, personality, and belief are constantly changing. It's as if they are indecisive about their life's decisions but in reality they are just struggling on trying to find what they actually love to do.</p>
				<p>Another part about this issue is people losing identity and absorbing society. This means that they are losing who they really are and taking the traits of other people and implementing it into their lives. This is somehow more common than you think it is and you might have already seen such an occurance before.</p>
				<p>The main problem here is that this type of issue can lead to a worse predicament if left unchecked. This can further lead to BPD or otherwise known as borderline personality disorder that also makes a person further lose their sense of self and their own identity crumbles apart.</p>

					<h3 id="title">Identity Theft</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Identity Theft is an immoral act that involves a person either rummaging through files, old computers or hacking public softwares, in order to obtain priceless private information about a subject. This subject will become the fraudsters victim and if he gets enough information about the subject, he can then continue and commit a further immoral act that gives trouble to the victim that he wasn't involved in.</p>
				<p>There are multiple different kinds of identity theft that happens all around the world. People take advantage of advanced technology and carelessness of some people for them to access priceless information that they can then use in order to commit Identity Fraud.</p>
				<p>Some types of identity theft are Financial identity theft, Child identity theft and Criminal identity theft.</p>
				<p>Each theft describes the action of the fraudster, as far as financial goes, bank accounts, credit cards, services, you name it, they can get access to it when they manage to steal your identity. For Child Identity theft, the fraudster usually uses an identity of a child, this child can either be a family member, a relative, or a deceased child, to obtain a home, an employment that is only suitable for people the same age as the child, and loans. In the act of Criminal Theft identity, the criminal will act like somebody else in order to avoid capital punishment or a warrant that is issued to them.</p>

					<h3 id="title">Identity Fraud</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Identity Fraud is known as an immoral act of using someone else's identity after commiting Identity Theft in order for them to gain their benefits and to induce the victim's downfall. These acts range from using a credit card of the victim to dealing with the government. These actions will further benefit the frauder but will leave a lot of trouble and debt fot the victim.</p>
				<p>In some cases, fraudsters use stolen identity to get more information about the victim for more access towards their belongings. They can steal concrete forms of identities in the form of driver's license, their passport, bank account, and much more.</p>
				<p>There is also another type of fraud that is called consumer fraud in which a fraudster or a criminal uses a fake or forged identity in order to access public transport, services, and priveleges they otherwise wouldn't be able to if they used their own identity. This is used widely by people who want to get access on something that isn't fit for their age. This is very dangerous especially if that something counts as an illegal belonging or rule of law that can lead to inprisonment.</p>
				<p>Another common theme of identity fraud is the usage of fake bank emails that send you fake notices about your accounts and ask you to send full information about your account. If you fall for this, they can use that information to personally obtain access to your account or scam you of your money.</p>
