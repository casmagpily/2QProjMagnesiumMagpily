In this website, I'll give you a proper tour on what Identity really is. Problems that are closely related to Identity such as Identity theft and Fabrication will also be mentioned later on in this website as well as Identity Crisis. <br><br>The whole aim of this website is to spread awareness on Identity crisis and theft and how problematic, or even life-threathening, it is to normal citizens like us. In the following pages, there lie more information about Identity in a general scale, How the Identity crisis and theft started, Further information about Identity theft, Fabrication and Identity Crisis, and how people are handling it in recent times.</p>
